I started to delve into my data set for the data project by first setting up my pandas notebook. While watching the tutorial video on each of the basic codes included in the basic pandas notebook, I took notes on their functions. I also learned a lot about slicing and folding. After the set up, I experimented a lot on how to change the values, recreate some of the graphs introduced, changing x and y limits, and other additional things like labels, titles, and colour. I started to implement my own data set into it. There were multiple errors that came up mid way, which I realized was an easy fix by rerunning all the data from the top. Another silly mistake that I made was using the code for the basic pandas notebook but forgetting to change the name of the data set or columns that I want the code to use. A problem that I came by was an error because the code couldn't read numbers that were floats. Thus, I added a code made the numbers numerical and to coerce any other parts of the data that couldn't be read or were filled with NaN.
