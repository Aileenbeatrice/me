This week, I learned more about how to parse a JSON and how to retrieve data from a link into the code. Throughout the exercise, I had difficulties trying to understand what part of the code I needed to edit and what was wanted as an outcome from each function. Nevertheless, I was able to slowly understand what each code needs to be filled with after having multiple discussions with people in class. Furthermore, learning 'w' and 'r' to make and read a file was also something to get used to in how they are formatted and the keywords needed to run the code. After a lot of trial and errors, I am gradually understanding how to create the code. However, I will need more practices to make myself comfortable in reading and making code from the instructions given.
