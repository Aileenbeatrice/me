This week, maps were introduced for the data project. I started learning about the use of geopanda so that I could use it to visualize the location of lakes for my dataset. However, after finding out that the code needs the longitude and latitude of the points to plot them to the map, I had trouble due to the fact that the lakes in my data set only had names and no location details. With help, I was able to retrieve the longitude and latitude points using code and used .merge to merge it to my data set to create the maps. I also learnt commands that could help me set the y axis and x axis limits so that I could zoom into the data. Other than that, I learned from the basic maps notebook the code to find out locations of suburbs based on distance and also how to use the cesntroid command.
