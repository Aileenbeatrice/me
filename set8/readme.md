The test/quiz gave me a chance to review my knowledge on what I know so far about coding and python. While I am slowly understanding the concept and how to apply that concept into the code that I want to type, I realized that I still forget the details and keywords I need to use to execute the code while practicing for the test. I think that I was heavily reliant on the templates/guidance that the exercises gave me, thus I didn't pay enough attention on how each line of code are parts of the process to get the desired outcome. I also had difficulties trying to apply my knowledge into the different questions that they gave, however by doing a lot of trial and error, I slowly refreshed what I knew from the past exercises. I had a really tough time doing the last few questions and couldn't make the code run successfully for the last question. Thus, I need to learn how to apply my knowledge for different situations so that I can waste less time.
