While implementing maps to my data, I realized that a normal map wasn't enough to visualize my intent due to the overlapping of data which covers one another. Thus, I found out that I could import folium to make an interactive map, where I could drag around and zoom in to look closer into specific values. I also played around with the line graphs to create a highlighted area, to indicate the normal range of of levels for specific columns in my data set. For that I had to make some functions and limit the columns I want to include in the maps.
I also had a last minute problem a day before the presentation where the zip file containing the shp file for the maps weren't recognized as a zip file by the system. However as I already have the shp file itself, I opted to making an entirely new code to open the shp file rather than having to go through the process of opening the zip file first. In jupyter lab, I also had the problem where they didn't have geopanda and other imports that I used in VS code, which I realised just had to be re imported again in codespace. Now that I've reached the last few weeks of this term, there were a lot of things that confused me and needed a lot of time to fix errors after errors. However, I became more familiar to similar types of problems I encountered and was able to understand what to fix.
